Term Definition 1. Flow The series of steps to execute 2. Flow steps The individual steps / parts of the flow,  It consists of the operation, the data definition for the step and the system configuration 3. Operations The predefined operations that can be used to define the flow steps.  Operations are the technical building blocks to access databases, REST or OData services etc 4. Systems Systems are the backend systems that you need to connect to fulfil your processes.  For e.g. to create an opportunity in Salesforce you will need to configure the Salesforce systems as part of the flow step 5. Forms Each flow has to be associated with a form.  A form can have any number of flows associated with it but each flow is associated to one form.  The flow has access to the user submitted data of the associated form 6. Task ID Every form that has to be filled is treated as a task for a user and identified with a unique TaskID 7. Submission ID Every form that is filled and submitted is identified with a unique SubmissionID.  Every form filling task has at least one submission id.  If a task is for a form set, each form of the form set that is completed will also have a submission id 8. Run on Save Flow to run when a form is saved. Note that a form can be saved any number of times until it is completed 9. Run on Complete Flow to run when a form is completed.  This flow is run only once (unless there is an error) and data is finalized 10. Run on Create Flow to run when a form is created or instantiated.  The flow can be used to prefill the data of the form 11. Run for Masterdata Flow to run when master data is required to be updated in the system or sent directly to the Turbo Forms App for form filling 12. Run via Smart Data Component (SDC) The flow is run as part of a Smart Data Component to fetch data from external systems based on user input and update form with results 13. Test Data Test data for a form that you can save for testing flows before deploying them 14. Run Run a flow in the builder to test it.  View detailed results and copy intermediate results 15. Save Saving a flow also runs a syntax check and returns a list of errors to fix. The flow step with the error is also highlighted 16.

Turbo Apps Builder The online App that manages the forms, flows and its usage 2. Turbo Forms App The Web and Mobile forms application that users can use to fill forms 3. Users Provisioned users in the system who can be assigned forms to fill and use the application to fill forms 4. Roles Users can have one of the following roles in the applicationAdmin - These users can provision users, design forms and assign them, etc.Manager - Managers can access data filled by their team members and approve themUser - Users who can fill and submit formsNote:  Users of any role can use the Forms application and fill forms 5. Teams Teams are a set of users belonging to a logical grouping. This can be corporate teams like HR or maintenance teams etc. Users can belong to multiple teams. 6. Category Categories help to group Forms together.  Each category can have as many forms as desired. 7. Forms Forms are filled by users and capture data in the field.  Completed forms can be submitted for review and other advanced flows by users. 8. Nested Forms Reusable form snippets that are designed independently and can be embedded in other forms. Changes to nested forms can be simultaneoulsy published to forms embedding them. 9. Formsets Formsets are a logical group or set of forms that belong together.  For e.g. a stockbroker enrollment form and a bank mandate are two individual forms that need to be filled together and make a Formset. 10. Master Data Master data are the fields/sets of data that do not change often and are referred to in forms.  For e.g. in a maintenance form, equipment is referred to and comprises master data.  This master data can be downloaded from external systems like SAP, Databases etc. 11. Flows No code designer to generate flows to run approvals, read master data and publish data to systems like Sharepoint, SAP etc.  Other systems include SQL compliant databases, OData, Microsoft Active Directory and many more.  Flows can be run on form save, completion, fetch results online in forms and for downloading master data. 12. Flow Input Flow Input a special input variable that can be used to pass in JSON data to Sub Flows.  Also when barcode events are triggered in the form they are posted to Smart Data Component using Flow Input. Lastly when webhook calls are received by the flow, all data posted to the webhook im parameters and body are accessible via the Flow Input variable 13. Smart Data Component Control that enables forms to read or write data online.  Also called SDC 14. Environment Key value pairs that can be associated with forms for use in the forms or flows like API tokens etc 15. Documents Documents that can be uploaded and associated with forms.

Note that this is also the maximum size of a single business object that can be sent to the device as a message needs to be made up of at least 1 business object (partial data is not allowed). MESSAGE_TOTAL_SIZE ALL Size of the total message that can be delivered to the device (Note that large messages will be split into smaller messages of size MESSAGE_UNIT_SIZE each). Set this value (in bytes) based on the amount of data that the device can accept without any performance issues, the default setting is 2097152 or 2 Mbytes. ENABLE_REST_API ALL Controls access to UDEP using the REST APIs. The REST APIs allow external systems to interact with UDEP and can be enabled or disabled based on requirement. REST_API_LOGIN_EXPIRY ALL Controls the expiry of REST API login. The accepted values are Never (no expiry) or expiry after 1 Hour, 1 Day, 1 Week or 1 Month. REST_API_MULTIPLE_SESSION ALL Controls whether each user is allowed to have multiple sessions via the REST API. If multiple is disabled, each user can have at most one \"application\" using REST APIs. If multiple is enabled, the login session is shared across multiple logins and can enable the usage of multiple applications built with the REST API. REST_API_LIMIT ALL Limits that number of REST API calls that an Unvired user can execute within a minute.  Note:  These limits are not imposed yet and are included as a failsafe. REST_API_CORS ALL Enable Cross Origin Resource Sharing(CORS) for REST API.  List all the domains you want to permit comma separated.  While * is a valid value, it is generally discouraged for security. MESSAGE_DISPLAY_LIMIT ALL The data stored for each message can be very large sometimes.

ALLOW_APPLICATION_COPY This option is only available to ROOT company (for e.g. UNVIRED) or partner companies selling applications on the UDEP. Set this to YES to allow other companies to purchase and copy the application to their namespace (source code needs to be provided for the client app and process agent) so that the customers can modify the app to their needs. 9. PROVISIONING This can be set to \"Administered\" wherein the UDEP administrator can deploy or provision applications for users. Set to \"AUTO\" for automatic provisioning wherein users can self-register on UDEP and use the application. 10. EMAIL_DOMAIN_ALLOWED Domains to be allowed has to be specified as a comma separated list. If * is specified all email domains will be allowed and is not recommended.  If left empty no email domains will be allowed. 11. LOGIN_MODULE Indicates which login mechanism is to be used for verifying user credentials. By default the \"UNVIRED-USER\" mechanism is used wherein the user needs to enter their Unvired ID on the mobile device to authenticate.Alternatively login can be via Email ID, SAML2 SSO, LDAP or MS ADS user or even SAP user. Developers can also provide a custom authentication mechanism wherein authentication is delegated by UDEP to a process agent function. See the sample Custom Login module in development guide for an example on how to build custom login modules.Note: For SAML2 SSO additional properties as explained in the SAML Single Sign On Advanced Configuration section will need to be configured. 12. LOGIN_CLASS Optional: If LOGIN_MODULE is set to Custom, the class implementing the authentication needs to be specified here. 13. CREATE_USER_PROCESSOR_CLASS Optional: If your application requires additional configuration that needs to be performed when a new user is created via API, the class implementing the additional steps needs to be specified here. 14. ATTACHMENT_PROCESSOR_CLASS Optional: Determines the class implementing the attachment processing for the process agent. One attachment processor per process agent needs to be specified here. If there are no attachments this field can be left empty. 15. PASSWORD_RESET_EXPIRY Password reset token validity in seconds. For e.g. to have a token valid for 1 day use 86,400 seconds, minimum is 10 minutes and max of 1 day. 16. JWT_TOKEN_EXPIRY Optional: If JWT token authentication is being used (SAML SSO or web applications for e.g.), the expiry of the issued tokens can be specified in seconds.  Default is 86400 seconds or 1 day. 17. JWT_SSO_APPS Comma separated list of other Apps that need to be trusted via this JWT token. 18. JWT_CLAIMS_PROCESSOR_CLASS Optional: Determines the class implementing the JWT token claims processing.  This class is required only if additional (custom) claims need to be included into the JWT token.  If not specified, only the standard claims will be included. 19. MOBILE_REDIRECT_URL Custom redirect URL for the mobile app like unviredapp://. Redirects to this URL will be captured by the mobile app for performing specialised functions like passwordless login etc. 20. USE_UNVIRED_ID_AS_FEDERATION_ID If this property is set to YES, UDEP will not look for a separate Federation ID for that user/application but will default the Federation ID to Unvired ID. This also means that the Federation ID need not be maintained in UDEP. 21. AUTHENTICATE_MOBILE_APP_INSTALL When set to YES, a login is required for the user to install Apps from the Unvired Enterprise App Store (typically when UDEP is exposed to the Internet or behind a reverse proxy). Set to NO if everyone is allowed to install (typically if UDEP is accessible only within a VPN or Intranet) 22. ONE_TIME_TOKEN_CHECK If ENABLED, every request from the device to the UDEP server is further protected with a one-time use token. This also ensures that the same user logs in to the application on a new device (custom front end id) the old device will automatically stop. 23. LOCAL_PASSWORD If set to YES (DEFAULT), when the mobile application starts the user will be prompted for the Unvired User ID and Password for local verification/authentication on the device. If set to NO, the mobile application will start without any password prompt. Recommended value is YES. 24. APP_LOCK_TIMEOUT Indicates the timeout interval on the device before prompting for password, if set to 0 the device will not lock. 25. DUPLICATE_CALL_HANDLING Decides the rule to apply when duplicate calls are received for functions downloading data to the device. Possible options:CALL_ALWAYS - Make a call irrespective of any pending or completed calls of the same functionIGNORE_CALL \u2013 Ignore the call if any pending or completed calls of the same function existDISCARD_DATA_AND_CALL \u2013 Discard any results for the previous calls (if any) and call again. 26. ALLOW_UMP_URL_OVERRIDE Allow to override the UMP URL to connect to with what is entered by the user in the client application instead of using the URL configured in the ME system properties.  This is useful in cases where ME is configured with an internal URL but applications need to use an external URL to connect to the server. 27. VERIFY_MESSAGE_HASH Optional: Server includes an additional hash with each message that is sent to the client.  This can be checked on client before accepting the data.  Recommended on slow / intermittent connectivity networks. 28. LOCATION_TRACKING Indicates if the location tracking will available for this application from the device. If set to Enabled, the device will automatically capture the location and transmit to the server. 29. APP_BASED_LOCATION_TRACKING Indicates if the location tracking will also record the application information along with the location. If the user has two applications on the mobile device enabled for location tracking, two sets of location information will be available on the server. 30. LOCATION_TRACKING_INTERVAL Indicates the interval (in seconds) on the mobile between location checks. 31. LOCATION_UPLOAD_INTERVAL Indicates the interval (in seconds) on the mobile when location information collected will be transmitted to the server. 32. LOCATION_TRACKING_DAYS Indicates the days of week to track location. Options available are MON-FRI, MON-SAT or MON-SUN 33.

Term Definition 1. Company / Domain UDEP is a multi-tenant platform.  Each tenant is identified by a Company ID (also called as Domain).  For e.g. the domain for Unvired Inc. is UNVIRED 2. SA SuperAdmin user who is automatically created for every company,  The SA user can perform all operations within a company and has unfettered access similar to a root account.  Use with care. 3. Users Users registered on the UDEP who can be Administrators, Developers or Application users.  Additionally users can have Frontend users (devices) attached to them.  They can also have backend users which refers to their individual credentials on these systems.  If the login to apps is via a different identity management system such as MS ADS they can also have Federation users attached. 4. Groups Groups of users who can be deployed applications to  se, run schedules for etc. 5. Backend System The systems that applications deployed in the UDEP connect to.  Some examples are SAP S4/HANA, SAP ECC, SFDC, databases like MySQL, MSSQL etc. 6. Backend Port The port that is configured on a system.  This is synonymous to a network port but in addition also identifies the service the port is configured for.  For e.g. RFC is a port on SAP systems and identifies both the port to connect to and that the protocol is SAP RFC.  Similarly HTTP(S) service on port 80/443 etc. 7. Backend Function A function that can be executed by a UDEP application.  Each function is provided by a Port and determines the type of function.  For e.g. an RFC function is provided by an SAP PORT that is available from an SAP Backend System.  Similarly a REST endpoint (function) is provided by a REST PORT on an HTTP(S) Web Server Backend System. 8. ME System ME is a special system in the UDEP landscape and refers to the system on which the UDEP platform is deployed and running.  All Process Agent Java functions are attached to the Java Port of the ME system. 9. Application An Application is the set of Functions that a Frontend (device or client) connects to for executing the required functionality. 10. Library A Library extends the functionality provided by an Application by adding more functions. 11. Application Properties Application Properties are a standard set of properties that can be configured for an application.  These are defined by UDEP and can be configured based on need.  For e.g. the output of the application (JSON or XML) can be controlled via an App Property. 12. Application Deployment This refers to the process of making applications available to users on the platform.  Administrators can deploy applications for users or teams. 13. Application Activation Once users login to the application via their credentials, the deployed application is marked as active on the specified device. 14. Process Agent Process Agent or PA is the binary Application that will be executed in the UDEP Java Runtime when a function is invoked,  The binary Jar file is obtained by compiling the Process Agent project in the Eclipse Modeler. All Process Agent functions are attached to the JAVA Port of the ME system. 15. Process Agent Settings These are Key-Value pairs that can be saved and accessed programmatically on the UDEP.  PA Settings can be App related or can be specific to the users accessing the application.  Custom configuration of an app can be stored as PA App Settings and user specific configuration and customization information can be stored as PA App User settings. 16. Frontend Refers to the devices or clients that the UDEP is aware of to receive incoming requests and to push messages to.  These include iPhone, iPad, Android Phones and Tablets, Windows Tablets, Browsers and other Servers. 17. Sync Requests (Messages) Synchronous or Sync refer to all the requests that are posted by the mobile and web applications to the UDEP platform synchronously for execution and receive the result of execution immediately. 18. Async Requests (Messages) Asynchronous or Async refer to all the requests that are posted by the mobile and web applications to the UDEP platform asynchronously for execution and receive an acknowledgement immediately upon queuing.  The request is subsequently processed and result is queued for delivery to the mobile devices. 19. REST Request Web Apps and other server integrations are executed on the UDEP by using REST APIs provided by UDEP.  These are then queued either Sync or Async based on the execution mode."},{"location":"udep/intro/","title":"Introduction","text":""},{"location":"udep/intro/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Unvired Digital Enterprise Platform (UDEP) is a web, mobility, offline, digitization and integration platform.

A chemical manufacturing company based in Houston has used UDEP to mobilize many business processes in Plant Maintenance and Warehouses on iPads. The customer uses offline mobile apps on iPads to access work orders, notifications inspection rounds, deliveries, compliance documents, and stock overview. Digital Platform Definition: UDEP enables digitization of documents, access to documents from anywhere (web, mobile), knowledge sharing, collaboration and data analytics helping customers convert to a Digital Enterprise. Paperless offices are a reality with UDEP.Where? An Oil and Gas company based in Canada has used UDEP to build an app that runs offline on Windows Tablets and as an online browser app also.  The codebase is identical for both platforms but uses the appropriate runtime/SDK from UDEP.  Integration with MS ADS ensures users login securely and access enterprise data at the office or on the move. Mobile Backend As A Service (MBaaS) or a Connector Framework Definition: UDEP offers many enterprise connectors to systems like SAP, SharePoint, Oracle, Databases, file systems and systems based on web services. UDEP works as a Mobile Backend As A Service (MBaaS) to expose enterprise system data/processes as REST services to external systems. The REST services can contain complex business logic. Where?  A retail company based in Houston has used UDEP to enable its custom retail software based on database stored procedures as REST services. The REST services expose delivery creation, inventory reconciliation, and new product addition. Schedulers in UDEP are used to pick the latest changes in the product information in the retail system, and relay it to the applications that use the product information. Offline and Conflict Resolution Framework Definition: UDEP offers a complete offline and conflict resolution framework for mobile apps. Mobile applications can use offline functionality to store data and submit later. Mobile applications can use conflict resolution to resolve data conflicts between enterprise systems and mobile devices.Where? A pharma company based in North America used UDEP to build a mobile application for warehouse management with offline access and resolve conflict with goods issue. Internet of Things (IoT) &amp; Server to Server Integration Platform Definition: UDEP enables data exchange between things and enterprise systems as well as between enterprise systems. UDEP can be the common hub for integration across mobile devices, things, and enterprise systems.Where?

Typical issues confronting a UDEP Administrator are:</p> <ul> <li>Users cannot login to the application.</li> <li>Users are unable to submit data to the server or download data.</li> <li>Users are getting errors on submission of data to the server.</li> <li>Push notifications are not working.</li> <li>Exceptions on the server or client.</li> <li>UAC is not responding.</li> </ul> <p>The issues are typically related to network issues in reachability of the UDEP server.  If this has been ruled out, the administrator can use the monitoring tools as follows:</p> <ul> <li>View the Device Monitor to check when the device last connected to the server, what is the model of the device and the software version, version of the App installed, was it updated recently.  This will give a fair idea on whether the device is establishing connections or not. </li> <li>The Admin can queue a PING request to the device and view the Async Monitor to check if the message is delivered to the device.  If the message is delivered then the device is confirmed to be online if not maybe the device is not able to reach the server,  Further checks on the device can be performed.  If all devices are not able to communicate it could also be a DNS issue or otherwise.</li> <li>View the Async Monitor and check if messages are being delivered to this device.  If a lot of READY messages are seen then the device is not downloading the messages.  Request the user to kill the application and restart it to check if connectivity is established and message flow is resumed.</li> <li>If the application has a synchronous behavior the Sync message monitor can be checked.</li> <li>All admin messages such as activation, push notification registration etc are all listed in the Sync Message Monitor as ADMIN_SERVICES messages.</li> <li>If push notifications are not working check if the push has been registered on the server by looking for the appropriate message.  If the user can be reached, request them to access the Settings screen and click on Test Push Notification.  A notification message is sent immediately for testing.  The Admin can also use the Users tab, select the user and choose the send notification option to send a message for testing.</li> <li>Retrieve the device logs and/or data for detailed analysis by placing a request either from the Users option or from the Device Monitor.  All logs and data that are retrieved from the device are displayed in the Device Logs and Data monitor.  If the device is not able to download the message, request the user to access the Settings screen and email the log to the administrator.</li> <li>For web applications the initial request received is recorded in the REST API log and can be viewed there.  These messages are then further forwarded either for Sync or Async processing and can be seen in the appropriate monitors with the respective conversation IDs.</li> <li>Sync, Async and REST API monitors also record the input and the output data. This is controlled by the App Property STORE_MESSAGE_DATA.  In production landscapes it is recommended to switch this off.  However in case of errors this can be turned on to view the data flowing. Additionally this setting can also be configured at a function level so that only specific functions can be traced.</li> <li>The Wildfly server log has a wealth of information and can be analyzed with the Conversation ID for detailed logs and exception troubleshooting.  AUDIT traces record all inbound and outbound calls.  Configure the standalone-full.xml (if you can restart the server) and set the com.unvired.ump.core and com.unvired.ump.web categories to INFO to see additional logs.  Note that com.unvired.ump.app should always be set to INFO level and controlled via the App Property.  If the server cannot be restarted, the Wildfly admin cockpit can be used to configure the logs while the system is online.</li> <li>Another issue why UAC or UDEP is slow or does not respond could be due to the slowness of the UDEP configuration database that it is connecting.  Ensure that there are enough connections in the configuration in the standalone-full.xml file.  Also use the Wildfly Admin Cockpit to monitor the number of database connections used and increase if necessary.</li> <li>Ensure that the UDEP database is fast and analyze for slow queries, slow database performance etc.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"udep/oauth/","title":"OAuth","text":""},{"location":"udep/oauth/#oauth-configuration","title":"OAuth Configuration","text":"<p>The UDEP supports connection to a number of backend systems and authentication models.
